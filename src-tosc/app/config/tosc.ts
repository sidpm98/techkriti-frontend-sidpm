      contentBody: 'In ancient India , Nalanda and Takshila Universities were lighthouse of education. Pupils who aspire for wisdom flocked to India to achieve their best. There was a time when these Indian universities were the epicenter of human values, courage, morality and education. But in the past 2000 years, we have gone through dark phases. Now again we are moving ahead to regain our past glory and the greatness. An important step in this direction is the inclusion of talent from all strata of life. TOSC provides a platform for bright brains with high aspirations to shine without any hindrance and prejudice. My experience with TOSC at IIT Kanpur was phenomenal. The event was duly organized and managed by the students of IIT Kanpur. It didn’t feel like we were gathered for a competition. We enjoyed many other activities. A campus visit was planned for all the participants after the lunch. The parents attended informative and enlightening sessions. We also got a chance to get taught from Prof.  H.C. Verma, who is an exceptionally brilliant and talented teacher. An interactive session with him made my parents think of universities like Nalanda and Takshila.  All the volunteers were very humble. TOSC is a very good platform for students to present their innovative ideas, increase their confidence and let their out of the box thoughts to be exhibited. I didn’t choose a hard and tough topic, instead, I presented different and innovative solutions for a very common topic i.e. “Climatic Change”. The event boosted the confidence of my younger brother, Abhimanyu, a lot.'

I just gave it a pet name to call upon "SMART TICKETS FOR WOMEN - ensures secure journey" . I take this opportunity to thank my parents and all those who are behind such massive competition for giving me a chance to think out of the box.'

It gives exposure to upcoming youngsters. It gave me a space, so that I could choose my own topic regarding to the problems faced by people in our surrounding and find innovative solutions to it. My topic was &quot;How to increase agricultural productivity of farm&quot;. In this attempts were made to minimise the rate of suicides done by farmers by increasing productivity using small patch of land.The most exciting thing organised by team Techkriti was the lecture by Sir H.C.Verma and campus visit.

I cleared it in my first attempt and was delighted to visit IITK campus. A visit to the air strip and an inspection of the gliders and the laboratories enlightened us with significant knowledge. Our interaction with IITians and the campus tour gave us an idea about the amazing life if an IITian and encouraged us to session was mind boggling and exposed us to new ways of learning through observation and daily activities. It cultivated in me a new perception of things. Our work was evaluated by IIT professors, which gav us room for improvement and confidence to present ourselves at higher levels. It was matchless. We learnt loads, and were able to design our own robots in the workshop held. TOSC gave me a chance to meet likeminded people from across India, thus sharing our thoughts and ideas to create better ones. I eagerly wait to be a part of the competition, workshops, discussions, interactions, next year too. TOSC is something for everyone; it forces us to do our best.'

      writeup: 'Hello, I am Utsav Munendra from Lucknow, UP and I achieved 2 nd  rank in TOSC 2016 in Pool B. TOSC is one of the rare competitions that evaluates students on more than just academic abilities. It moves forward to reward students who are not only intellectually brilliant, but are also capable of applying their skillset to solve the most pressing problems in the world around them. Although the first round was entirely based on logical reasoning, the quality of questions was far beyond what I have ever seen in any other exam and it asked variations of some famous mathematical puzzles like the Josephus Problem. In the abstract and presentation round, I got the practical experience of applying theoretical knowledge to solve the problem of filthy rivers in India. As I went on to research for the solution, the answers I got were surprising simple and changed my perspective on river cleaning, and this whole experience would not have been possible without TOSC. My panel of judges included Prof. Santanu Misra, who did not remain a passive evaluator of presentations, but in the end gave valuable advice to all the students on how to make better presentations. To all the future participants, all I can say is that TOSC will be a memorable competition for them also and they must enjoy the tour of the campus offered after the presentations and stay till the prize distribution, or they might end up not getting the prize books, uh… like me'
