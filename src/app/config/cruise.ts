### Networking Fundamentals

Networks are defined as medium for communication between two or multiple systems, i.e. it con-
stitutes a mechanism of information that travels across multiple devices using various mediums,
concepts of Domain name system, Servers, Connection mechanism.
This module will cover in depth knowledge of OSI model and TCP/IP model and how data is
transmitted through network, along with various Protocols used at each layer with focus on Net-
working Layers, Network design and implementation and what devices are used for the data
transmission i.e. hardware associated with networking like switches, router, hub etc along with
types of network, internet protocol v4 & v6, ports & protocols, sub netting concepts, domain name
system and its working, Network architecture and standards.

### Open Source Intelligence

Open source intelligence (OSI) is focused on collecting as much information as possible about a
target which can be organization, a person, website or a specific system.
The module is designed to give insight of OSI methods and techniques i.e. various ways to collect
information from publicly available resources like e-Mail spoofing, Fake mail Tracing by using
various methods.
The module will provide elementary knowledge about advance search techniques in various
search engines used by security professionals, cyber criminals. Introduction to social engineering
technique like phishing for email id hacking, desktop phishing, remote phishing and how it is es-
sential in information gathering.

### Network Attacks

The module will begin with an introduction of loopholes in protected Wi-Fi networks and its test-
ing. Students will be able to learn, how to test security of a protected Wi-Fi network.
In the later phase module will include hands on demonstration of internal network attacks like
sniffing.
Module will cover scanning networks for live systems and their open ports further it will include
operating system finger printing and grabbing banners of running services on remote system.
It will also give insight on scanning of known vulnerabilities.

### Malware : Attacks & Detection

The course will cover basic terminologies and concept of Malware - definition, why and how it is
affecting the network and the system, key tools and techniques of malware attacks.
Students will be briefed about creating Malware and various types of malware (virus, worms, Tro-
jans, key loggers etc.)
Concepts of antivirus and their working along with it techniques to identify Malwares which are
not detected by AVs will be taught.

### Web Application Attacks

Introductory knowledge of database and working with database using SQL queries along with
installation and working for local servers. Basic working of HTTP with request and host exam-
ples. Basic html, JavaScript, php, sql are included in this module to make students better under-
stand the loopholes. By the end of this module, students will be able to test for different type of
loopholes in web application security.

### Cyber Crime

This session will include various cybercrime cases and criminal modus operands. Also will be
discussed various cybercrime cases handled by HICUBE along with investigation procedure.
Methods to handle cybercrime cases and Dos and Donâ€™ts of handling cybercrime cases will be
discussed. Indian IT act with reference to case studies from HICUBE will be discussed.
